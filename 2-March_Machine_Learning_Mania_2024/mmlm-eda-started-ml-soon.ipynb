    "We have thanks to these two datasets : \n",
    "\n",
    "These files identify the different college teams present in the dataset (MTeams is for the men's teams and WTeams is for the women's teams). Each school is uniquely identified by a 4 digit id number. Men's team id's start with a 1 and women's team id's start with a 3, and typically there is exactly a difference of 2000 between the men's and women's team id's for a given school. For example, the men's Arizona State team id is 1113 and the women's Arizona State team id is 3113. You will not see games present for all teams in all seasons, because the games listing is only for matchups where both teams are Division-I teams. There are 362 teams currently in Men's Division-I and 360 teams currently in Women's Division-I. Each year, some teams might start being Division-I programs, and others might stop being Division-I programs. For example, this year there is one new Division-I program (Le Moyne) and two programs that have stopped being Division-I programs (Hartford and St Francis NY). So there will be some teams listed in the data only for historical seasons and not for the current season, and thus there are more than 362 men's teams and more than 360 women's teams listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TeamID** - a 4 digit id number, uniquely identifying each NCAA¬Æ men's or women's team. A school's TeamID does not change from one year to the next, so for instance the Duke men's TeamID is 1181 for all seasons. To avoid possible confusion between the men's data and the women's data, all of the men's team ID's range from 1000-1999, whereas all of the women's team ID's range from 3000-3999.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TeamName** - a compact spelling of the team's college name, 16 characters or fewer. There are no commas or double-quotes in the team names, but you will see some characters that are not letters or spaces, e.g., Texas A&M, St Mary's CA, TAM C. Christi, and Bethune-Cookman.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FirstD1Season** - the first season in our dataset that the school was a Division-I school. For instance, FL Gulf Coast (famously) was not a Division-I school until the 2008 season, despite their two wins just five years later in the men's 2013 NCAA¬Æ tourney. Of course, many schools were Division-I far earlier than 1985, but since we don't have any data included prior to 1985, all such teams are listed with a FirstD1Season of 1985. This column is only present in the men's data, so it is not found in WTeams.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LastD1Season** - the last season in our dataset that the school was a Division-I school. For any teams that are currently Division-I, they will be listed with LastD1Season=2024. Again, this column is only present in the men's data, so it is not found in WTeams.csv."

    "We have thanks to these two datasets : \n",
    "\n",
    "**Season** - indicates the year in which the tournament was played. Remember that the current season counts as 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DayZero** - tells you the date corresponding to DayNum=0 during that season. All game dates have been aligned upon a common scale so that (each year) the Monday championship game of the men's tournament is on DayNum=154. Working backward, the men's national semifinals are always on DayNum=152, the \"play-in\" games are on days 134-135, men's Selection Sunday is on day 132, the final day of the regular season is also day 132, and so on. All game data includes the day number in order to make it easier to perform date calculations. If you need to know the exact date a game was played on, you can combine the game's \"DayNum\" with the season's \"DayZero\". For instance, since day zero during the 2011-2012 season was 10/31/2011, if we know that the earliest regular season games that year were played on DayNum=7, they were therefore played on 11/07/2011. Also note that the men's and women's data share the same DayZero each season, although the women's championship game is not necessarily played on DayNum=154\n",
    "\n",
    "**RegionW, RegionX, Region Y, Region Z** - by our competitions' convention, each of the four regions in the final tournament is assigned a letter of W, X, Y, or Z. Whichever region's name comes first alphabetically, that region will be Region W. And whichever Region plays against Region W in the national semifinals, that will be Region X. For the other two regions, whichever region's name comes first alphabetically, that region will be Region Y, and the other will be Region Z. This allows us to identify the regions and brackets in a standardized way in other files, even if the region names change from year to year. For instance, during the 2012 men's tournament, the four regions were East, Midwest, South, and West. Being the first alphabetically, East becomes W. Since the East regional champion (Ohio State) played against the Midwest regional champion (Kansas) in the national semifinals, that makes Midwest be region X. For the other two (South and West), since South comes first alphabetically, that makes South Y and therefore West is Z. So for that season, the W/X/Y/Z are East,Midwest,South,West. And so for instance, Ohio State, the #2 seed in the East, is listed in the MNCAATourneySeeds file that year with a seed of W02, meaning they were the #2 seed in the W region (the East region). We will not know the final W/X/Y/Z designations until the brackets are announced on Selection Sunday, because the national semifinal pairings in the Final Four will depend upon the overall ranks of the four #1 seeds."

Thus, there are between 64-68 rows for each year, depending on whether there were any play-in games and how many there were. In recent years the structure has settled at 68 total teams, with four \"play-in\" games leading to the final field of 64 teams entering Round 1 on Thursday/Friday of the first week (by definition, that is DayNum=136/137 each season). We will not know the seeds of the respective tournament teams, or even exactly which 68 teams it will be, until Selection Sunday on March 17, 2024 (DayNum=132).\n",

For play-in teams, there is a fourth character (a or b) to further distinguish the seeds, since teams that face each other in the play-in games will have seeds with the same first three characters. The \"a\" and \"b\" are assigned based on which Team ID is lower numerically. As an example of the format of the seed, the first record in the MNCAATourneySeeds file is seed W01 from 1985, which means we are looking at the #1 seed in the W region (which we can see from the \"MSeasons.csv\" file was the East region).\n",

    "These files identify the game-by-game results for many seasons of historical data, starting with the 1985 season for men (the first year the NCAA¬Æ had a 64-team men's tournament) and the 1998 season for women. For each season, the file includes all games played from DayNum 0 through 132. It is important to realize that the \"Regular Season\" games are simply defined to be all games played on DayNum=132 or earlier (DayNum=132 is Selection Sunday, and there are always a few conference tournament finals actually played early in the day on Selection Sunday itself). Thus a game played on or before Selection Sunday will show up here whether it was a pre-season tournament, a non-conference game, a regular conference game, a conference tournament game, or whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Season** - this is the year of the associated entry in MSeasons.csv or WSeasons.csv, namely the year in which the final tournament occurs. For example, during the 2016 season, there were regular season games played between November 2015 and March 2016, and all of those games will show up with a Season of 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DayNum* - this integer always ranges from 0 to 132, and tells you what day the game was played on. It represents an offset from the \"DayZero\" date in the \"MSeasons.csv\" or \"WSeasons.csv\" file. For example, the first game in the \"MRegularSeasonCompactResults.csv\" file was DayNum=20. Combined with the fact from the \"MSeasons.csv\" file that day zero was 10/29/1984 that year, this means the first game was played 20 days later, or 11/18/1984. There are no teams that ever played more than one game on a given date, so you can use this fact if you need a unique key (combining Season and DayNum and WTeamID). In order to accomplish this uniqueness, we had to adjust one game's date. In March 2008, the men's SEC postseason tournament had to reschedule one game (Georgia-Kentucky) to a subsequent day because of a tornado, so Georgia had to actually play two games on the same day. In order to enforce this uniqueness, we moved the game date for the Georgia-Kentucky game back to its original scheduled date.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WTeamID** - this identifies the id number of the team that won the game, as listed in the \"MTeams.csv\" or \"WTeams.csv\" file. No matter whether the game was won by the home team or visiting team, or if it was a neutral-site game, the \"WTeamID\" always identifies the winning team. Please note that in this case the \"W\" in \"WTeamID does not refer to women's data; the \"W\" is for \"winning\". Both the men's data and women's data will identify the winning team id by this WTeamID column. The same note applies to WScore and WLoc below - these are \"W\" for \"winning\" and not for \"women's\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**WScore** - this identifies the number of points scored by the winning team.\n",
    "LTeamID - this identifies the id number of the team that lost the game.\n",
    "LScore - this identifies the number of points scored by the losing team. Thus you can be confident that WScore will be greater than LScore for all games listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WLoc** - this identifies the \"location\" of the winning team. If the winning team was the home team, this value will be \"H\". If the winning team was the visiting (or \"away\") team, this value will be \"A\". If it was played on a neutral court, then this value will be \"N\". Sometimes it is unclear whether the site should be considered neutral, since it is near one team's home court, or even on their court during a tournament, but for this determination we have simply used the Kenneth Massey data in its current state, where the \"@\" sign is either listed with the winning team, the losing team, or neither team. If you would like to investigate this factor more closely, we invite you to explore Data Section 3, which provides the city that each game was played in, irrespective of whether it was considered to be a neutral site.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NumOT** - this indicates the number of overtime periods in the game, an integer 0 or higher."

Although they would not be games you would ever be predicting directly for the NCAA¬Æ tournament, and they would not be games you would have data from at the time of predicting NCAA¬Æ tournament outcomes, you may nevertheless wish to make use of these games for model optimization, depending on your methodology. The more games that you can test your predictions against, the better your optimized model might eventually become, depending on how applicable all those games are. A similar argument might be advanced in favor of optimizing your predictions against conference tournament games, which might be viewed as reasonable proxies for NCAA¬Æ tournament games."
